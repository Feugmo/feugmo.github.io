Conrard Giresse Tetsassi Feugmo was born in Cameroon. After his M.Sc in Theoretical Chemistry at the [University of Yaoundé I](https://www.alluniversity.info/cameroon/university-of-yaounde-i/), he completed a M.Sc in Nanotechnology at the [Catholic University of Louvain la Neuve (Belgium)](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html) and received his Ph.D in Computational Chemistry in 2018 from the  [University of Namur (Belgium)](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=university+of+namur&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). His Ph.D research focused on the simulation of Sum-Frequency Generation spectroscopy. After immigrating to Canada, he was first Postdoctoral associate at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca), then Research Officer at the [Advanced materials research facility](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/nrc-facilities/advanced-materials-research-facility)  of The National Research Council  of Canada and now [Assistant Professor of chemistry at the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/).

His research is focused on computation, machine learning and AI methods for materials in sustainability-related domains, gas sensor, aerospace , and automotive. His research group mainly engages multiscale simulations, including First principle calculations,  Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo,  and Phase-field model together with machine learning to unravel the structure–property relationship.
