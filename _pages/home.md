Research at Chemical Artificial Intelligence Lab @UWaterloo is focused on computation, machine learning and AI methods for materials in sustainability-related domains, gas sensor, aerospace , and healthcare. The  group mainly engages multiscale simulations, including First principle calculations,  Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo,  and Phase-field model together with machine learning to unravel the structureâ€“property relationship.
