Welcome to the Chemical Artificial Intelligence Lab @UWaterloo (Chem AI Lab)

Our research is focused on computation, machine learning and AI methods for materials in areas related to sustainability, gas sensors, aerospace and healthcare. The  group mainly engages multiscale simulations, including First principle calculations,  Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo,  and Phase-field model together with machine learning to unravel the structureâ€“property relationship.
