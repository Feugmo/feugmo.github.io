Dr. Conrard Giresse Tetsassi Feugmo  completed  a  B.Sc. and  M.Sc. in Chemistry  at  the [University of Yaoundé I](https://uy1.uninet.cm)  ([Cameroun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon) ). Thereafter,  he moved to Belgium and received and Advanced Master in Nanotechnologies  from the [Louvain School of Engineering (Belgium)](https://uclouvain.be/en/faculties/epl) and a Ph.D in Computational Chemistry in 2018 from the  [University of Namur (Belgium)](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=university+of+namur&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). His PhD research focused on the vibrational Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) spectroscopy of functionalized surafces. From 2019 to 2020 he was a postdoctoral associate at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca), investigating the optical properties of Poly Phenylene Ethynylene (PPE) derivatives, and the Immunogenic Cobalt Porphyrin Lipid Bilayers. In 2020 Conrard  joined the National Research Council of Canada as  Research Officer. As a member of the team at the NRC's new [Advanced materials research facility ](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/nrc-facilities/advanced-materials-research-facility) in Mississauga (NRC-M), Conrard  uses his expertise in chemistry and nanotechnology to accelerate scientific discovery through a combination of big data and smart algorithms. Conrard and his team use machine learning to accelerate the design and development of high entropy alloys; and support the  Artificial Intelligence for Design (AI for Design) Challenge program as well as the  Materials for Clean Fuels Challenge program.

At date,  he started a new position as Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/). He has published numerous papers and has been recognized for excellence in research, teaching, and outreach. In the future, he hopes to develop an innovative open-source platform where AI, Computation and Experimentation are all combined to effectively address the challenges areas related to sustainability and healthcare.
Conrard speaks  [Yemba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemba_language), French, and  English


Away from the office…  Conrard spends a lot of time with his family, plays soccer and music.
