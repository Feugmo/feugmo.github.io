There are more than 870 kinds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human breath. These VOCs provide important information about metabolic disorders or dysfunction in the human body. Human breath is  feasible candidates for either invasive or noninvasive detection of VOCs for diagnosis of diseases. Breath analysis is a method to diagnose disease by detecting changes in the VOCs in exhaled breath. This method is a noninvasive, direct, and low-cost technique, which may contribute to the development of predictive, preventive, personalised, and participatory (“P4”) medicine. The VOCs in breath, such as alcohols, aldehydes, acids, and ketones, are produced by different biochemical and physiological processes. Abnormal VOC levels indicate an abnormal metabolic state, and they can be used to distinguish sick patients from healthy people. Some VOCs in breath are biomarkers of certain diseases. Once the concentration of VOCs in breath samples is sufficiently high, diagnosis and the following treatment should be performed as soon as possible.However, it is challenging to precisely determine VOC concentrations in breath, and typical endogenous VOCs in the range of 1–5000 ppb (parts per billion) can be quantified using GC-MS technology.

Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors detect concentration of various types of gases by measuring the resistance change of the metal oxide due to adsorption of gases. Atmospheric oxygen residing on the MOS surface is reduced by the target gases, allowing more electrons in the conduction band of the metal oxide material.
