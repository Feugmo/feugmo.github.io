 - Ammonia (NH3) is currently the second most highly produced chemical in the world with a global manufacturing capacity of ∼230
million tonnes (Mt) per year.

-  Ammonia is  an effective hydrogen carrier  (17.6 wt %) and  ease of storage and transportation.  Ammonia also shows promising potentials for clean electricity generation viasolid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), exhibiting cell performance comparable to that of the hydrogen fuelled counterparts.

- Electroreduction of nitrogen to ammonia  (NRR) has advantages of mild operating conditions, zero-emission of carbon dioxide. Benefiting from these merits, the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia is expected as a promising alternative to the high energy consumption, and the large carbon footprint Haber-Bosch process. The research on  NRR can be divided into several aspects including the development of catalysts and strategies to improve selectivity. During the electrochemical NRR, NRR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) take place at the cathode and compete with each other.  





Coming Soon :alarm_clock:

- N2 to NH3 (NRR)  and NOx to NH3 (NOxRR)
- NH3 to N2 and NOx
-  Machine learning
