The electrochemical synthesis of ammonia by  nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has advantages of mild operating conditions, zero-emission of carbon dioxide, hydrogen carrier (17.6 wt %), fertilizer from renewable sources, and ease of storage and transportation. Benefiting from these merits, the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia is expected as a promising alternative to the high energy consumption, and the large carbon footprint Haber-Bosch process. The research on  NRR can be divided into several aspects including the development of catalysts and strategies to improve selectivity. During the electrochemical NRR, NRR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) take place at the cathode and compete with each other.
