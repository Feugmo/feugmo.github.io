Hydrogen (H2) is being promoted as a promising energy carrier and fuel source with high efficiency and zero-emission. On a weight basis, hydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of gasoline (120 MJ/kg for hydrogen versus 44 MJ/kg for gasoline). Metal hydrides have been widely studied as storage materials because they are able to store larger amounts of hydrogen in smaller volumes at low pressure, and at temperatures close to room temperature. Storing enough hydrogen onboard a vehicle to achieve a driving range of greater than 300 miles is, however, a significant challenge. Although reversible storage in metal hydride shows promise, adequate knowledge of materials meeting all requirements of hydrogen content, release temperature, and simultaneous reversibility is a major drawback. The hydrogen storage performance and reversibility are often influenced by the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transformations and associated microstructures of the storage materials. In this regard, multiscale modeling and simulation could provide the foundational understanding of physical mechanisms leading to different types of mesoscale phase microstructures of solid-state hydrogen storage materials involving multiple intermediates.  This is essential for identifying the rate-limiting processes of (de/re) hydrogenation in order to predict and improve the hydrogen storage performance/reversibility

As of 2022, there are three hydrogen car models available to the public in some markets: the Toyota Mirai (launched in 2014), which is the world's first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), and the Hyundai Nexo (presented in 2018). Recently,  NamX has launched  theNamXperience GT version with 800km autonomy.
