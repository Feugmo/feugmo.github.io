abstract = {{To achieve an equitable energy transition toward net-zero 2050 goals, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to chemical feedstocks through utilizing both CO2 and renewable energy is particularly attractive. However, the catalytic activity of CO2RR is limited by the scaling relation of the adsorption energies of intermediates. Circumventing the scaling relation is a potential strategy to achieve a breakthrough in catalytic activity. Herein, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a high-entropy alloy (HEA) system of FeCoNiCuMo with high catalytic activity for CO2RR. Machine learning models were developed by considering 1280 adsorption sites to predict the adsorption energies of COOH*, CO*, and CHO*. The scaling relation between the adsorption energies of COOH*, CO*, and CHO* is circumvented by the rotation of COOH* and CHO* on the designed HEA surface, resulting in the outstanding catalytic activity of CO2RR with the limiting potential of 0.29–0.51 V. This work not only accelerates the development of HEA catalysts but also provides an effective strategy to circumvent the scaling relation.}},

abstract = {{We propose a neural evolution structure (NES) generation methodology combining artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms to generate high entropy alloy structures. Our inverse design approach is based on pair distribution functions and atomic properties and allows one to train a model on smaller unit cells and then generate a larger cell. With a speed-up factor of ∼1000 with respect to the special quasi-random structures (SQSs), the NESs dramatically reduce computational costs and time, making possible the generation of very large structures (over 40 000 atoms) in few hours. Additionally, unlike the SQSs, the same model can be used to generate multiple structures with the same fractional composition.}},
