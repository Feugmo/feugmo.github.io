abstract = {{Eumelanin is an important pigment, for example, in skin, hair, eyes, and the inner ear. It is a highly heterogeneous polymer with 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) building blocks, of which DHICA is reported as the more abundant in natural eumelanin. The DHICA-eumelanin protomolecule consists of three building blocks, indole-2-carboxylic acid-5,6-quinone (ICAQ), DHICA and pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA). Here, we focus on the self-assembly of DHICA-eumelanin using multi-microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at various concentrations in aqueous solutions. The molecule was first parameterized using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Three types of systems were studied: (1) uncharged DHICA-eumelanin, (2) charged DHICA-eumelanin corresponding to physiological pH, and (3) a binary mixture of both of the above protomolecules. In the case of uncharged DHICA-eumelanin, spontaneous aggregation occurred and water molecules were present inside the aggregates. In the systems corresponding to physiological pH, all the carboxyl groups are negatively charged and the DHICA-eumelanin model has a net charge of −4. The effect of K+ ions as counterions was investigated. The results show high probability of binding to the deprotonated oxygens of the carboxylate anions in the PTCA moiety. Furthermore, the K+ counterions increased the solubility of DHICA-eumelanin in its charged form. A possible explanation is that the charged protomolecules favor binding to the K+ ions rather than aggregating and binding to other protomolecules. The binary mixtures show aggregation of uncharged DHICA-eumelanins; unlike the charged systems with no aggregation, a few charged DHICA-eumelanins are present on the surface of the uncharged aggregation, binding to the K+ ions.}},

abstract = {{To achieve an equitable energy transition toward net-zero 2050 goals, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to chemical feedstocks through utilizing both CO2 and renewable energy is particularly attractive. However, the catalytic activity of CO2RR is limited by the scaling relation of the adsorption energies of intermediates. Circumventing the scaling relation is a potential strategy to achieve a breakthrough in catalytic activity. Herein, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a high-entropy alloy (HEA) system of FeCoNiCuMo with high catalytic activity for CO2RR. Machine learning models were developed by considering 1280 adsorption sites to predict the adsorption energies of COOH*, CO*, and CHO*. The scaling relation between the adsorption energies of COOH*, CO*, and CHO* is circumvented by the rotation of COOH* and CHO* on the designed HEA surface, resulting in the outstanding catalytic activity of CO2RR with the limiting potential of 0.29–0.51 V. This work not only accelerates the development of HEA catalysts but also provides an effective strategy to circumvent the scaling relation.}},

With a speed-up factor of ∼1000 with respect to the special quasi-random structures (SQSs), the NESs dramatically reduce computational costs and time, making possible the generation of very large structures (over 40 000 atoms) in few hours. Additionally, unlike the SQSs, the same model can be used to generate multiple structures with the same fractional composition.}},

title = {Experimental and Computational Observations of Immunogenic Cobalt Porphyrin Lipid Bilayers: Nanodomain-Enhanced Antigen Association},
abstract = {{Cobalt porphyrin phospholipid (CoPoP) can incorporate within bilayers to enable non-covalent surface-display of antigens on liposomes by mixing with proteins bearing a polyhistidine tag (his-tag); however, the mechanisms for how this occurs are poorly understood. These were investigated using the his-tagged model antigen Pfs25, a protein antigen candidate for malaria transmission-blocking vaccines. Pfs25 was found to associate with the small molecule aquocobalamin, a form of vitamin B12 and a cobalt-containing corrin macrocycle, but without particle formation, enabling comparative assessment. Relative to CoPoP liposomes, binding and serum stability studies indicated a weaker association of Pfs25 to aquocobalamin or cobalt nitrilotriacetic acid (Co-NTA) liposomes, which have cobalt displayed in the aqueous phase on lipid headgroups. Antigen internalization by macrophages was enhanced with Pfs25 bound to CoPoP liposomes. Immunization in mice with Pfs25 bound to CoPoP liposomes elicited antibodies that recognized ookinetes and showed transmission-reducing activity. To explore the physical mechanisms involved, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bilayers containing phospholipid, cholesterol, as well as either CoPoP or NTA-functionalized lipids. The results show that the CoPoP-containing bilayer creates nanodomains that allow access for a limited but sufficient amount of water molecules that could be replaced by his-tags due to their favorable free energy properties allowing for stabilization. The position of the metal center within the NTA liposomes was much more exposed to the aqueous environment, which could explain its limited capacity for stabilizing Pfs25. This study illustrates the impact of CoPoP-induced antigen particleization in enhancing vaccine efficacy, and provides molecular insights into the CoPoP bilayer properties that enable this.}},

title = {Theoretical investigation of vibrational sum-frequency generation signatures of functionalized H-Si(111)},
abstract = {{Developments toward a general approach for simulating and interpreting the sum-frequency generation signatures of functionalized surfaces are reported. This approach encompasses two steps: (1) The molecular properties (vibrational frequencies, IR and Raman quantities) are evaluated using first-principles approaches implemented in standard quantum chemistry programs, and (2) the macroscopic optical responses (second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor) of the adsorbate on its substrate are determined within the three-layer model of the interface. A homemade code was written to carry out this second step, including (1) the evaluation of the Fresnel factor and (2) the determination of the molecular orientation in the laboratory frame. This approach and program allow for the generation of the SFG spectra for different combinations of molecular orientations and experimental setups, as well as the identification of the vibrational modes to facilitate their analysis. Then, the approach is illustrated in the case of a decyl chain covalently bonded to hydrogen-terminated Si(111) [Si(CH2)9CH3]. The simulated ppp spectrum agrees closely with experiment, whereas the agreement gets worse when parts of the chain are frozen, demonstrating that the SFG signature originates from a large part of the decyl chain. Calculations were also performed for the other sets of polarizations (sps, ssp, and pss), highlighting the fact that the spectral profile varies considerably from ppp to ssp, sps, and pss, which is attributed to the combined effects of the Fresnel factors and the structure of the χ(2),R tensor. The impact of the orientation of the alkyl chain (tilt and rotation angles) on the ppp SFG intensity was then monitored by reducing the system to an isolated decane molecule and determining the changes in the SFG spectral pattern related to the orientation of the IR dipole moment.}},
